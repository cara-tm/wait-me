p. Fine handcrafted theme for your maintenance mode during your website development. Includes specific headers to search engine bots in order to differ indexations in later revisits. Minimal design with extremly subtile colored shadows around the custom picture (extracted from the image itself); additional text, social network links and contact links governed by TXP variables for immediat use. No javascript, no dependencies, Responsive with Flexbox inside for modern browsers and IE7 minimum capable!

h2. How to?

p. Unzip the distribution and place the theme folder @wait-me@ into your @/root/themes@ directory.

p. Upload an image of your choice, that must be named @0@, into your @/root/images@ directory (dimensions: 350 Ã— 500 px). This will be the image that is displayed with the main page; set the extension image file with the corresponding TXP variable into the pages. To support the "Retina Display" screens, please download the same image of twice the size and named <code>0@2x</code> with the same file extension.

p. The theme use only 2 pages: "default" and "error_default" where you could find some TXP variables to set accordingly to your needs. Finaly, activate it.

p. *Note*: the email address for the contact feature is grabbed from the one set as the administrator of your website.
